<!-- excerpt start -->
Earlier this month, Jimmy was at the [24th International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM 24)](https://iccm24.com/) in Baltimore to provide an update about his research on using [Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) to model the [Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin_transfer_moulding) process. Our results show the potential of GNNs to replace mesh-based simulations from the microscopic (fiber) scale to the macroscopic (manufactured part) scale.

An extensive journal paper on the subject will be published in the coming months.

We thank [Polyworx B.V.](https://www.polyworx.com/) for access to their flow simulation software.
