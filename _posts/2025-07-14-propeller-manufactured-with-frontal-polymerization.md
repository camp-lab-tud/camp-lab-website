<!-- excerpt start -->
Weâ€™ve just achieved a landmark in composite manufacturing: curing a 1-meter propeller using frontal polymerization (FP)! ðŸš€

This energy-efficient technique harnesses self-sustaining reaction fronts to cure thermoset resins in minutes â€” not hours â€” significantly reducing energy use by more than 90% compared to conventional oven or autoclave methods, which are both time- and energy-intensive.

This milestone was made possible thanks to [NXTGEN Hightech](https://nxtgenhightech.nl/) funding and in collaboration with [KVE](https://www.kve.nl/). Special thanks to [Koen Geers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koen-geers-644757155/).

Why this matters:
- âœ… Scalability demonstration: FPâ€™s viability for large, complex parts was previously limited by heat dissipation. Our trial overcame this using optimized initiators and thermal management.
- âœ… Industrial potential: FP enables rapid, out-of-autoclave production of high-performance composites (e.g., aerospace, renewables) without sacrificing fiber volume fraction.
- âœ… Sustainability: Dramatically cuts manufacturing emissions and costs.
