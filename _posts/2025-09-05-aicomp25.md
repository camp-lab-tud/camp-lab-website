<!-- excerpt start -->
Our group was excited to attend the first [AIComp 2025](https://composites-ai.org/) in Bristol.
<!-- excerpt end -->

A few highlights:
- Baris and Ashish delivered talks on our recent work applying AI to accelerate cure and flow modelling (partly supported by [Caelestis](../projects/caelestis)).
- Baris chaired the session on AI-Driven Process Modelling and Simulation in Composites.
- And, of course, we enjoyed exploring Banksyâ€™s street art in Bristol.
