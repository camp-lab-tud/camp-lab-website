<!-- excerpt start -->
We are pleased to announce the special session **Digital Twins and AI for Composite Manufacturing: Modelling, Monitoring and Control** (session 8.13) organised by Dr. Iryna Tretiak (University of Bristol) and Dr. Baris Caglar (TU Delft) at the **22nd European Conference on Composite Materials (ECCM22)**, which will take place in Oslo, Norway, on 21–25 June 2026.
<!-- excerpt end -->

The session aims to showcase state-of-the-art methods, emerging applications, and future directions for intelligent, high-quality, and sustainable composite manufacturing.

The following topics of interest will be covered:
- Process optimisation and real-time control in automated fibre placement, resin transfer moulding, additive manufacturing, and other composite processes
- Defect detection using computer vision or sensor fusion
- Digital twins for manufacturing processes
- Predictive models linking structure, process, and properties

We look forward to receiving abstracts, which should be submitted through the [ECCm22 website](https://www.ntnu.edu/eccm22/home).
