  description: We introduce an image-based surrogate framework to estimate velocity and pressure fields in unidirectional composite microstructures of arbitrary size, and then derive permeability from those fields. The models deliver ≈5% error on training data and ≈8% on unseen microstructures; inferred permeabilities deviate by only ≈4% (train) and ≈6% (validation). A physics-based sliding-window procedure extends predictions to microstructures with varying aspect ratios. Validated against high-fidelity simulations and CT scans of samples, the approach offers a scalable, computationally efficient alternative to costly numerical solvers. The code and trained models are [openly available to the community](/code-and-data).

  description: This work proposes a methodology to manufacture 3D-printed hydrophilic microfiltration membranes with ≈10 µm cylindrical pores dual-wavelength microstereolithography and PEGDA resin. Membranes were characterized (SEM, FTIR, contact angle, roughness), showed comparable permeability to commercial PTFE membranes, and effectively separated oil-in-water emulsions. The membrane permeability was analyzed via a 1D tube model and numerical modeling, revealing effects of material swelling and pore deformation, offering guidance for design optimization.

  description: This paper introduces a self‑catalyzed frontal polymerization technique for producing high fiber volume fraction polymer composites in a fast, low‑energy process. The reaction front propagates rapidly by implanting thin resin channels in thermal contact with the composite stack, optionally using fillers to tune cure kinetics, preheating the fabric, and eliminating the need for continuous external heating. The resulting parts have a significantly higher glass transition temperature than those produced in a conventional oven, and comparable mechanical properties, while energy consumption is reduced by over 99.5%.

  description: This paper presents the results of an international benchmarking study involving 19 participants measuring out-of-plane permeability using standardized guidelines. Statistical analysis showed that following these guidelines significantly reduced variability and outliers. The findings support the proposed method as a strong candidate for standardization.
