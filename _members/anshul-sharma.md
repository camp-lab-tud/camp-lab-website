Anshul is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Aerospace Structures and Materials at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands, since October 1, 2024. He completed his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering in India, after which he worked for a year at Hysitron Nanotechnology India Pvt. Ltd. He then served as a part-time lecturer at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India, for a year. Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India, focusing on “Novel analytical approaches for testing and evaluation of biomaterials using infrared imaging studies”. During his Ph.D., under the supervision of Prof. Ravibabu Mulaveesala and Prof. Navin Kumar, he worked on the development of active infrared thermographic systems for the nondestructive and noninvasive inspection of industrial and biomedical materials. Before joining TU Delft, Anshul held the position of Institutional Postdoctoral Fellow at the Centre for Sensors, Instrumentation and Cyber Physical System Engineering (SeNSE), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he specialized in non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) of industrial and biomedical materials, with a particular focus on infrared thermography (IRT).

At TU Delft, his research is centered on inline monitoring of ultrasonic-welded (USW) thermoplastic composites using infrared thermography.
