Jimmy is a PhD candidate in aerospace engineering at TU Delft. He received his Master's degree in civil engineering (specialization in computer-aided engineering) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) (2023). Prior to that, he completed his Bachelor's degree in civil engineering at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) (2021).

Jimmy's research lies at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and composites manufacturing. He currently focuses on developing high-fidelity ML surrogate models (e.g., graph neural networks, convolutional neural networks) to simulate the manufacturing process of advanced composites (specifically, resin transfer molding) at multiple scales. Besides, his past research experience during his Master's studies involved generalizing [deep material networks](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00466-024-02493-1) and improving the [data-driven computational mechanics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00466-022-02255-x) framework.
