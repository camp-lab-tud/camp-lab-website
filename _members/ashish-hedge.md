I am a PhD Candidate, hailing from India. I studied Mechanical Engineering in India and then worked with electronics at Bosch before moving to London to do my Master's in Materials Science at Imperial College. I then lived for a short while in Stuttgart, working at Bosch GmbH, before starting my PhD at TU Delft in the Netherlands, thus continuing to gather valuable academic and life lessons from geographically and culturally different places. In a world that is experiencing a rapid evolution in AI technologies, I am passionate about researching the application of AI-based techniques to solve problems in materials and manufacturing.

In my free time, I love watching and playing football and video games, and I can talk endlessly about either of those topics.
