I am a PhD candidate in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft. My research primarily revolves around developing uncertainty quantification and multi-fidelity modeling for machine learning models. In addition, applying the developed methods in the field of computational mechanics, with a specific focus on creating innovative composites for recycled polymers. Before joining TU Delft, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. During my Master's program, my research efforts were dedicated to exploring active-learning surrogate methods for reliability analysis.
