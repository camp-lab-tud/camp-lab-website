Guillaume Broggi is a postdoctoral researcher in the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft. He develops physics-aware, data-driven tools to accelerate the design and manufacturing of high-performance composite structures. His research integrates experimental characterization, physics-based modelling, and scientific machine learning (SciML) to deliver deployable surrogate models. His recent research focuses on ML surrogates for micro-flow prediction in resin transfer molding, improving multi-scale impregnation modelling for enhanced design and process control. 

Guillaume completed his PhD in the Laboratory for Processing of Advanced Composites at EPFL, within an MSCA Doctoral Network. He contributed to the HyFiSyn project on the fracture behavior of thin-ply and hybrid carbon composites, developing strategies to enhance their translaminar toughness and notched strength. Before pursuing a PhD, Guillaume obtained a MSc from Georgia Tech and Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech.

Guillaume is active in open-source software, promotes transparent and reproducible research, and supports adopting SciML in composite manufacturing workflows.
