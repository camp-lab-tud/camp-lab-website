Guillaume Broggi is a postdoctoral researcher in the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft. He develops physics-aware, data-driven tools to accelerate the design and manufacturing of high-performance composite structures. His research integrates experimental characterization, physics-based modelling, and scientific machine learning (SciML) to deliver deployable surrogate models. His recent research focuses on ML surrogates for micro-flow prediction in resin transfer molding, improving multi-scale impregnation modelling for enhanced design and process control. 

Guillaume completed his PhD in the [Laboratory for Processing of Advanced Composites at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpac/), within the [MSCA Doctoral Network HyFiSyn](https://www.hyfisyn.eu/). His research focused on fracture behavior of thin-ply and hybrid carbon composites, developing strategies to enhance their translaminar toughness and notched strength. Before pursuing a PhD, Guillaume obtained a MSc from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en).

Guillaume is active in open-source software, promotes transparent and reproducible research, and supports adopting SciML in composite manufacturing workflows.
