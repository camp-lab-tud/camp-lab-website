# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

We are a multidisciplinary team at TU Delft led by Prof. Baris Caglar. Our research combines experimental techniques and numerical approaches, including machine learning, to study the properties of composite materials and their manufacturing. We believe great science happens in open, diverse, and collaborative yet excellence-minded environments, and our team reflects those values.
