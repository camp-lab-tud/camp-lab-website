# The Composites and Advanced Materials Processing Lab

CAMP Lab is a research group at [TU Delft (NL)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) focusing on advanced materials processing and composite structures. The group is led by [Prof. Baris Caglar](members/baris-caglar), and is part of the [Aerospace Structures and Materials department from the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/organisation/departments/aerospace-structures-and-materials).

At CAMP Lab, our research focuses on sustainable composites and their manufacturing through resource and energy efficient processing enabled by data-driven approaches. The three main pillars of our research are:
- **Resource-efficient** advanced composites based on unidirectional thermoplastic tapes 
- **Energy-efficient** processing of thermoset-based advanced composites through frontal polymerization
- **Data-driven** approaches for improved process design and control through the use state-of-the-art AI models
