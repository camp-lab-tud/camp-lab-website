<!-- excerpt start -->
In the manufacturing of aerospace structures, such as aircraft fuselage panels, ultrasonic welding (USW) is gradually adopted for joining fuselage sections. However, the high-frequency vibrations involved in the USW process can sometimes induce defects at the welded locations due to uneven energy input, causing non-uniform heating, material degradation, fiber misalignment, or void formation at the weld interface. Detecting these defects is essential for maintaining structural integrity and reliability.
<!-- excerpt end -->

The present project focuses on inline monitoring of ultrasonically welded thermoplastic composites (CF/PPS) to ensure the production of defect-free structural components, thereby improving the safety and extending the service life of aerospace structures.
