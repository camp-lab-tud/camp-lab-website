<!-- excerpt start -->
The 3D printing process is prone to errors due to the complex nature of the various printing parameters and environmental uncertainties. Defects can appear in multiple ways, leading to failed prints or parts with compromised mechanical properties. This affects the reliability of the 3D printing process, and higher production rates of 3D-printed parts are challenging to achieve. This research focuses on developing methods that effectively monitor and control the 3D extrusion printing process. Desktop 3D printing and large-format 3D printing of thermoplastics and composites are considered within the scope of this research.
