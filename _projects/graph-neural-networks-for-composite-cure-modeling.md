<!-- excerpt start -->
Motivated by the need to minimize the development time and production costs of aerospace composite parts without compromising their quality, this project focuses on leveraging the power of AI-based surrogates for modelling material behavior.
<!-- excerpt end -->

The aim of this research is to use graph neural networks in a MeshGraphNet-based architecture to develop data-driven and physics-informed surrogate models that will simulate the curing of composites. Fast predictions of a trained, robust AI model will facilitate high-throughput process design through cure-cycle optimization, mould design optimization, and minimizing process-induced defects. This would accelerate the design and manufacturing cycle significantly compared to the current reliance on computationally expensive Finite Element Modeling (FEM).
