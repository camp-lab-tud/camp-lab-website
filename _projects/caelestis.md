<!-- excerpt start -->
CAELESTIS is funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe programme and seeks to advance aviation through virtual prototyping, lightweight materials, and high-performance computing.
<!-- excerpt end -->

We contributed to the CAELESTIS project by conducting the two following researches.

## Development of machine-learning surrogates for the efficient estimation of microscale permeability

## In-situ method to homogenize the laminate’s permeability in a fiber dry placement technique 

A novel in-situ methodology to reduce the variability of fiber impregnation during the infusion process in the manufacturing process using automated fiber placement.
